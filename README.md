# nautical_neopixel

This arduino sketch is designed to be programmed into a framed nautical chart in order to light up the buoys, lighthouses, channel markers and other lighted nautical aids to navigation found on a NOAA nautical chart. Each light has a color and flashing/timing characteristic which can be simulated. This would make an interesting art display or a project for someone learning or experimenting with microcontrollers.

For this project due to the number of LEDs possibly required I went with neopixels (ws2812b or other similar individually addressable RGB LED lights).

See the comments in the sketch for more information.

You can simulate the operation of the LEDs on Tinkercad https://www.tinkercad.com/things/gWAsxpgxWYh
